Thank god someone made it...
* What happen?
There was a crash, you don't remember anything?
** Weird, I don't.
I'll tell you all about it in a bit, we need to get situated first.
*** What should I do?
- I saw some logs a bit past us, I think we'll be able to craft something if we get them. Can you go collect them? #E.ShowBlueDoor
* Sure, I'll see what I can do. #E.HideBlueDoor
- Sweet, come back to me once you're done!
* Got it. #E.HideBlueDoor
